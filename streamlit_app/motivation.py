        This project is part of our Master's program, specifically focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
        As part of our end-of-year project, we aimed to explore the potential of semantic embeddings in improving review ranking and recommendation systems. 
        Traditional methods like BM25 have long been used for information retrieval tasks, but their limitations in understanding context and user intent motivated us to investigate whether NLP-based models, specifically those leveraging semantic embeddings, could offer better, more accurate results. 
        The project serves as an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained throughout the course and pushes the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in review-based platforms like TripAdvisor.
